I want you to write a small system for managing your music collection. The system should be accessible from the command line. I would interact with it like so:

        $ ./music

        Welcome to your music collection!

        > add "Ride the Lightning" "Metallica"

        Added "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica

        > add "Licensed to Ill" "Beastie Boys"

        Added "Licensed to Ill" by Beastie Boys
        
        > add "Pauls Boutique" "Beastie Boys"

        Added "Pauls Boutique" by Beastie Boys

        > add "The Dark Side of the Moon" "Pink Floyd"

        Added "The Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd

        > show all

        "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica (unplayed)
        "Licensed to Ill" by Beastie Boys (unplayed)
        "Pauls Boutique" by Beastie Boys (unplayed)
        "The Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd (unplayed)

        > play "Licensed to Ill"

        You're listening to "Licensed to Ill"

        > play "The Dark Side of the Moon"

        You're listening to "The Dark Side of the Moon"

        > show all

        "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica (unplayed)
        "Licensed to Ill" by Beastie Boys (played)
        "Pauls Boutique" by Beastie Boys (unplayed)
        "The Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd (played)

        > show unplayed

        "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica
        "Pauls Boutique" by Beastie Boys

        > show all by "Beastie Boys"

        "Licensed to Ill" by Beastie Boys (played)
        "Pauls Boutique" by Beastie Boys (unplayed)

        > show unplayed by "Beastie Boys"

        "Pauls Boutique" by Beastie Boys

        > quit

        Bye!

        $

--------------------------

As shown above, the program should accept the following commands:

- **add "$title" "$artist"**: adds an album to the collection with the given title and artist. All albums are unplayed by default.
- **play "$title"**: marks a given album as played.
- **show all**: displays all of the albums in the collection
- **show unplayed**: display all of the albums that are unplayed
- **show all by "$artist"**: shows all of the albums in the collection by the given artist
- **show unplayed by "$artist"**: shows the unplayed albums in the collection by the given artist
- **quit**: quits the program


Some other stipulations:

- Please use either javascript or ruby and don't use a framework for this.
- Assume that there can never be two albums with the same title in the system (even if they were to have different artists). The user shouldn't be allowed to add two albums with the same title.
- **Do not** use a persistence mechanism (ie, a SQL database) for the albums. Store them in memory. That is, every time you run the program, the list of albums should be empty. Using a database can make some aspects of this a little too easy :)
- This homework usually takes one or two evenings to complete. The code should be written as would be in production (error checking, tests, etc)
- Please submit your solution to us via github repository link
