The idea is to create a Slack chatbot that tells the weather. The minimum features are:

- Can assume that all requests are for one location (no need to manage individual user location.  An instance of the bot can serve "New York" only).

- Respond to two commands triggered upon mention. "Weather now" and "Weather tomorrow".  They do what you'd expect.

- When the weather is going to be significantly different from yesterday, let @channel know in the morning.

- One embellishment of your choice. Determine a feature you think this bot should have, and implement it.
